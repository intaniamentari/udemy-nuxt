# Hi, I'm Intania Mentari Mustika

Welcome to my portfolio! 🎉

I’m glad you stopped by, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself. So, here it goes: I’m a Back-End Developer, and I've been on this career path for almost three years now (still quite the journey ahead! 💪🚀). My day-to-day work includes creating features, developing admin dashboards, building APIs, and sometimes even working with servers 🖥️. If we’re talking future goals, I'd love to become a DevOps Engineer 👩‍💻! Servers fascinate me, and I’ve been getting pretty comfortable with a few CLI commands here and there 💻.

A little more about me—I value freedom and enjoy getting skilled in things that bring me joy, like advancing in my career, managing my time effectively, and even cooking (I'm a big foodie! 🍲🍰).

In my free time, I’m often doing something active (walking is a favorite 👟🌞) or food-related (whether it’s trying new places or hunting down delicious bites—yum! 🍜🫰).

I have to admit, I can get easily distracted by things that spark my curiosity, like new framework updates (I'm a big Laravel fan 🤘✨), tech trends, or cool new libraries. It’s easy to get carried away! To keep myself on track, I usually jot down these things in Google Keep to check out later when I have free time 📋📝.

Oh, and are you a cat lover? I absolutely adore cats—their presence brightens up my world 😸💕. Along with that, chocolate 🍫 has been my go-to whenever I hit a mental block or need a boost while working through back-end challenges 🧩⚙️.

This intro might be getting a bit long, so let’s wrap it up here. Thank you so much for taking the time to read a little about me! 😊

With ❤️,  
Intania Mentari Mustika
